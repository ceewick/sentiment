Actively listening to users' feedbacks and reacting to them very quickly4. Excellent working environment, right next to the Venice Beach. I've worked in a number of companies before and this is the best working place so far.","Not much that I am aware of.

2," Apr 21, 2015",empReview_6404745,Current Employee - Anonymous Employee,None,The best experience of my professional career thus far.,"Snapchat has been the best experience of my professional career thus far. It is a true start-up, but without the risks. No job is too small or too large, and the amount of impact and influence you have in your role (whether you're an intern or an exec) is infinite. It's a collaborative and friendly environment, and the organization truly values and invests in the individuals.The work is fast paced and challenging and you're surrounded by the most intelligent individuals on a daily basis. If you're looking for growth and excitement, you will find it at Snapchat.","Hours can be long and the workload can be heavy. I don't necessarily see this as a con, however, as the growth potential as an individual due to these two factors is bigger than I've seen at most companies.Also note that Snapchat is not the kind of place for someone looking for frills and perks. It's a place to get your hands dirty and there are times where you might be working on projects outside of your day-to-day responsibilities. For some, like myself, I love this. For others, this can be frustrating and if you're the type of person that's looking for routine and predictability, this place probably isn't for you. Snapchat requires flexibility and a team oriented mentality.","Continue to enable, encourage and invest in the talent. As the organization grows, would love to see the culture stay intact. Also given the rapid growth, would like to see us stay away from becoming too process driven, as some organizations move in this direction.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Snap-Reviews-E671946.htm/Reviews/Employee-Review-Snap-RVW6404745.htm

However, Snapchat is a place that turned out to be as, if not a little more serious, than most of them. The people here are extremely driven and motivated.I think what drives a lot of Snapchat's views, beliefs, and policies, is the fact that it has not let its ideologies be motivated or influenced by external stimuli. Most of the decisions taken here are very objective and independent, and unlike a lot of what I saw at various Bay Area firms. A lot of this originates from the upper level management.My favorite thing about working here is being in the middle of such a rapid and crucial growth phase. Being an active part of such growth is a very educational process, and it is really motivating to see people going above and beyond to push the company forward. It really shows and promotes a general sense of ownership and dedication.","Rapidly growing company size means reducing personal touch with everyone else.

30," Apr 16, 2015",empReview_6362972,Current Employee - Software Engineer,I have been working at Snap full-time (Less than a year),Wonderful experience to be part of a passionate and fun loving team.,"- Interview Experience: Unlike other big name companies, the entire interview process was very smooth, quick and well structured. It took me about 2 weeks from the time the recruiter first contacted me to the time I got the offer. The recruiters were really prompt on following up on all the minor details, very adjustable to scheduling and quick to respond on interview results. The overall interview experience itself was unique where I had my lunch interviewer take me for a walk by the beach after having lunch with the entire team. The interviews were very similar to what you expect at any top tech company but I really liked the fact that I was allowed to code in an IDE of my choice instead of writing on white board.- On-boarding process: The new hire on-boarding process is brief and to the point. It was a sweet surprise to see that people already know you by name when you are taken for walk around the campus buildings.- Engineering team: The engineering team is well organized and well structured. Its a great opportunity to do full stack development where you are allowed to work on features end to end. There is a strong sense of ownership and commitment to deliver features. Every team has a good mix of junior and senior developers. Since it is such a small team and the product is growing continuously, there are plenty of opportunities to showcase your potential and grow.- Work: Because of the unique and ephemeral nature of the product, the work is really challenging and interesting. It's good to have your entire day focussed on solving the problem as I spend less than 30 minutes a day on emails and meetings. It also allows me to get work done quickly and leave early.- Office space: Although, I was initially skeptical about working in an office space right by the beach, I have started to really like it now. Its literally a beach house transferred to office space and it has all the amenities with an amazing view from the roof top and the deck. Whenever I see myself getting stuck in a problem, I tend to go for a walk by the beach to the shore and refresh myself. Sometimes, we just go out and relax ourselves with a game of volley ball. The office staff are really kind and there is security people in and around the building 24X7.- Food: It's really great that I can turn up at work and not worry about cooking lunch or dinner as food is prepared by the chef daily and the entire team has lunch together.

Our manager is very smart, but it doesn't change the fact that it's very hard for one person who doesn't understand 100% of every single job they manage to represent everyone at the same time. We aren't a small company.

Large user base. Advertising model is a value proposition.Seems like the sky is the limit. CEO has been right a lot. Quality of people coming in the door is high. Made some good hires from what I can see. People who know how to ship products and do so profitably.IPO paperwork has been filed. Could be a big payoff. Everyone works hard. It's good if you have something to show for it.Benefits are excellent compared with previous employers.,"There's so much going on it can be hard to focus.No way of knowing how long the free wheeling culture will last.Roles and responsibilities beginning to overlap as more people are brought onboard, creates some confusion.Rapid growth and rate of hiring makes me wonder if company can execute on big plans.Long hours and demanding workload. Work/Life balance tips heavily towards work.","When forming such a large team, do things to make sure everyone is pulling in the same direction. Keep an eye on company culture.

69," Nov 10, 2016",empReview_12626941,Former Employee - Story Editor,I worked at Snap full-time (More than a year),"An exciting job, marred by some organizational deficiencies","I worked as a story editor on the content team, curating submitted snaps for their Live Stories. There are really good benefits and perks — you don't have to pay into healthcare, the snacks are pretty sweet, there are occasional activities like free group workout classes. You feel like you're working at one of the most exciting companies in the world. You can have a pretty big say in projects even without a ton of past work experience; Snapchat generally values the input and creativity of its employees, and wants be cooler and more innovative than anywhere else and that led to some really fruitful creative work. The pay is really good.","Horrific and irregular hours, far worse than initially advertised in the job description. It was not uncommon to work on both overnight and daytime shifts in the same week, which was nuts and totally destabilized any ability to have a social life outside of work. That's something that not might be visible from the outside, but attention toward employee wellness in this respect was minimal. There's a lack of diversity in the company overall — the content team at one point was definitely one of the more diverse teams (racially + gender-wise) but leadership and management is vastly white and male, which led to interpersonal issues and some tone-deafness in regard to content decisions. A relatively flat organizational structure meant it was difficult to get promoted or see the potential for a longer-term career ladder.",Schedule your content team more conscientiously. Hire more people who don't look like you. Set better standards for work-life balance. Offer more opportunities for growth and advancement.,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Snap-Reviews-E671946.htm/Reviews/Employee-Review-Snap-RVW12626941.htm
